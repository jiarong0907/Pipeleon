## Examples

We provide several examples in the [examples](examples) folder. All of them can directly run by `python3 program_name`.

- [e2e_topk_optimization.py](examples/e2e_topk_optimization.py) is an end-to-end example that shows all steps of the optimization.

- [group_optimization.py](examples/group_optimization.py) demonstates the usage of group optimization on top of top-k optimization.

- [optimize_and_eval.py](examples/optimize_and_eval.py) compares the performance gain and time between topk search and exhaustive search.

- [pipelet_option_gain_cost.py](examples/pipelet_option_gain_cost.py) compuates all optimization options for each pipelet in a program.
